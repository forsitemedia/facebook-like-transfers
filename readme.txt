Accumulates Facebook likes even when switching from http to https.


== Description ==

Accumulates Facebook likes even when switching from http to https. If you switch from http to https, your original http links may have all the likes. This plugin works around this problem, by setting your OpenGraph URL meta tags on older posts to the http version of the post.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `facebook-like-transfers` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the Facebook Like Transfers plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin by going to your `general options` settings page. The Facebook Like Transfers date may be set here (only posts older than the date set there will be set to http)
